When you click the button, the server will reply with the current server time and send it again every second.
This uses WebSocket to maintain a connection between the server and the client.

- [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.2/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html) or [play](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/Installing) installed and runnable from the command line.
