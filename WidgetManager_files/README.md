This folder contains the three files needed to be able to install and use the WidgetManager.

_WidgetManager.scala_ and _RxPlay.scala_ have to be placed in your app/ directory (or in any subdirectory). In order to use a WidgetManager object in your application, you need to import both of the RxPlay and WidgetManager classes.

_WidgetManager.js_ has to be placed in your resources folder.
